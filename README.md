Restaurant Menu Application - manage menus for a group of restaurants. 

##About

This is a database backed web application. 
First built from scratch. Then, because it takes a long time writing python web servers, 
I made use of Flask to do a lot of the heavy lifting. 



##How To Use

1. Run database_setup.py with a python interpreter
2. Run lotsofmenus.py with a python interpreter
3. Run project.py with a python interpreter. 

The application should now be up and running. You can now see a list of restaurants. 
Click on one to see the menu, to which you can add, edit or delete items. 

##Contributing

I will load this on GitHub and then happily welcome anyone to provide any constructive 
criticism of this project in particular, or my coding in general. I just want to get better. 
(This updated submission is not yet updated to GITHub, rather, I will submit after grading of the project, in case there are further errors.)


##License

tl;dr - The MIT License (MIT)

So, I don't really care about trying to own information, this isn't the 90s.
Do what you like with this or anything else as I don't think anyone can actually own information, just because current laws say that they can. I mean, who am I to say who can
know what, or who on earth thinks they can dictate what my mind is allowed to know...
So, take this and use it, and any other code I write.
